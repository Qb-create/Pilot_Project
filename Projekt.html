            <p>Dear friend,</p>
<br>
<p>Human behavior hasn’t changed since 1966.</p>
<br>
<p>Actually, you could plug in any year before 1966 (1066?) and say the same thing.</p>
<br>
<p>And while many think Breakthrough Advertising is only about creative, copywriting and direct marketing, it is more importantly about human behavior…</p>
<br>
<p>…how we can predict it and</p>
<br>
<p>…understanding why people make decisions at the deepest level.</p>
<br>
<p>Gene Schwartz said over and over both publicly and to me in private:
“The greatest mistake marketers make is trying to create demand.”
And one of the most fascinating things you should know about Gene is that he was never about trying to create mass desire.</p>
<br>
<p>Rather, he saw his job as channeling and directing the mass desire in the market toward his product.</p>
<br>
<p>He makes it sound so simple.</p>
<br>
<p>But when one of the world’s greatest copywriters to ever live lets the rest of us in on his secret to success, we must pay attention.</p>
<br>
<p>Breakthrough Advertising contains the careful documentation of an Advertising System that has been quietly producing millionaires since 1966.</p>
<br>

<p>And soon you'll see, that when combined with the easy to follow training program Breakthrough Advertising Mastery you’ll be implementing Gene’s system at breakneck speed.</p>
<br>
<p>You’ll learn more about Breakthrough Advertising Mastery below…
</p>
<p>It's a "one of a kind" resource that will let you in on how Gene thought and how he saw the world.</p>
<br>
<p>Learning the Breakthrough Advertising System will be like putting on a new pair of glasses - a new lens that lets you see the world differently.></p>
<br>
<p>And once you learn Gene’s system, everywhere you look you’ll start seeing </p>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Unlimited ideas for "impossible to ignore" marketing hooks</li>
  <br>
  <li>How those headlines you love to swipe are actually created and</li>
  <br>
  <li>How to breathe life back into your old offers and</li>
  <br>
  <li>Create new instant winners simply by learning to think like Gene!</li>
  <br>
</ol>

<p>Stick with me and I’ll prove all of this to you in just a second…</p>
<br>
<p>In My 40 Year Career Running The Direct Marketing Company Boardroom, I Hired And Worked With Nearly Every A-List Copywriter You Can Think Of…</p>
<br>
<p>And They Were All Students Of Breakthrough Advertising</p>

    <div>Three Basic Steps to Understanding The Breakthrough Advertising System</div>
    <div>
    <p>Let’s walk through the basic strategy of persuasion found inside Breakthrough Advertising and Breakthrough Advertising Mastery. </p>

<p>There are three essential steps at the heart of Gene's system.</p>  
<p>Step 1: Identify the dominant desire that creates your market.</p>
<p>Every person who buys from you is looking for a transformation.</p>

<p>They desire to move from where they are currently into a new reality.</p>

<p>Identifying this dominant desire is your first step and it’s the focus of Chapter 1 of Breakthrough Advertising and Breakthrough Advertising Mastery.</p>
<p>Step 2: Identify how your product’s performance creates the market’s desired transformation.</p>
<p>You need to show the market that the transformation they desire is the natural outcome of using your product.</p>


<p>The market needs to see that the solution to their problem runs through your product.</p>

<p>You will start learning Gene’s process for doing this in chapters two and three of Breakthrough Advertising and Breakthrough Advertising Mastery.</p>
<p>Step 3: Segment your market based on their state of awareness and sophistication level.</p>
<p>States of Awareness and Levels of Market Sophistication are probably the two most quoted concepts from Breakthrough Advertising. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, they’re also the most misunderstood.</p> 

<p>And that’s due to the number of marketers who teach their own interpretations of these concepts, watering them down and diluting their true power. </p>

<p>The States of Awareness and Levels of Market Sophistication are first introduced to you in Chapters 3 and 4 of Breakthrough Advertising. But they are woven into every chapter that follows.</p>

<p>The important thing for you to grasp right now is this:</p>

<p>At each State of Awareness and each Level of Market Sophistication, your prospect is asking a different set of questions that your marketing must answer.</p>

<p>“One size fits all” marketers waste their time and money when they show Product Aware messaging to a Problem Aware audience.</p>

<p>These two market segments are asking completely different questions.</p>

<p>Inside Breakthrough Advertising and Breakthrough Advertising Mastery you will see how to identify the questions that your market is asking at each level.</p>

<p>And this will allow your marketing to build a deeper bond with your audience because it will feel more personal.</p></div>
